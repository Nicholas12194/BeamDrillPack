# BeamDrillPack
BeamDrillPack, a mod for Terraria using tModLoader

Thank you for downloading the Beam Drill Pack! This mod adds in 10-16 Beam Drills, all modled after the Vanilla Laser Drill. The purpose of this mod is to give the player a fast digging tool early on, so as to avoid the slog of digging with the sluggish pre-hardmode pickaxes. However, the mining power of the Beam Drills is dependant on what material they are made from. This is intended to expidite tedious digging while still preserving the game's progression.

A configuration setting called "EasyMode" may be changed to suit your preferences in My Games/Terraria/ModLoader/ModConfigs/BeamDrillPack.
If you would prefer to gain access to the lowest-tier Beam Drill variations very soon after starting the game, set this setting to "TRUE".
If you prefer to have to do a little work to earn your first Beam Drill, set this setting to "FALSE".

FALSE: The lowest tier Beam Drill will be the Meteor Beam Drill, crafted at an anvil using 20 meteorite bars, 10 emeralds, and a lens.
The next upgrade to the Meteor Beam Drill is the Hellstone Beam Drill.

TRUE: Enables crafting of the Copper Beam Drill at an anvil, using a copper pickaxe, a glowstick, and a lens.
Also enables crafting of the Tin Beam Drill at an anvil, using a tin pickaxe, a glowstick, and a lens.

The next upgrade to the Copper/Tin Beam Drill is the Gold/Platinum Beam Drill, then the Demonite/Crimson Beam Drill, then the Hellstone Beam Drill.

After the Hellstone Beam Drill, the next upgrades are Cobalt/Palladium, Mythril/Orichalcum, Hallowed, Chlorophyte (using beetle husks, so Golem must be defeated. This may be changed in the future.),Laser (using the vanilla Laser Drill), and Luminite.
