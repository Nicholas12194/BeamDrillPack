The Beam Drill Pack includes 15 new drills modeled after the Laser Drill.
The Purpose of this mod is to provide a very fast digging tool that is easy to obtain, but still follow the normal progression of the game by limiting what that tool can mine.
The lowest tier Beam Drill (Copper and Tin) can be crafted at an anvil using your starting pickaxe, a lens, and a glowstick.
Each tier beyond that requires you to "Upgrade" a lower tier Beam Drill to get it.

If you like to dig fast and hate how sluggish the early pickaxes are, this is the mod for you.

If you do not like digging fast or believe that the ability to do so should be earned, this is not the mod for you.

Have fun, and hold on tight!
