The Beam Drill Pack includes 16 new drills modeled after the Laser Drill.
The Purpose of this mod is to provide a very fast digging tool that is easy to obtain, but still follow the normal progression of the game by limiting what that tool can mine.
The lowest tier Beam Drill (Copper and Tin) can be crafted at an anvil using your starting pickaxe, a lens, and a glowstick.
Each tier beyond that requires you to "Upgrade" a lower tier Beam Drill to get it.

<<<New to 1.0.3!>>>
If you think the Tin and Copper Beam Drills are too powerful for their cost, you can choose to start with the Meteor Beam Drill instead. The recipe is 20 meteorite bars, 10 emeralds, and a lens, crafted at an anvil.


If you like to dig fast and hate how sluggish the early pickaxes are, this is the mod for you.

If you do not like digging fast or believe that the ability to do so should be earned, this is not the mod for you.

Have fun, and hold on tight!
